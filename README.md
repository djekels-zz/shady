# Steps taken thus far.
In working with this request I ran into multiple hurdles.
  - Day 1: wanting to make this vagrant work on my mac-book I discovered that rvm in missing and x-code kept complaining about library dependancies, this rat hole kept me occupied for a few hours untill I simply gave up.
  - Day 2: decided to scrape together older hardware and install ubuntu LTS whichever was the latest stable version.
  - Day 3: here we are no further than where I left off yesterday midnight. with no luck moving forward.

Now I am asking for help so I can move forward.
